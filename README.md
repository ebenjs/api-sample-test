# API Sample Test

# Project improvement recommendations

Below are my suggestions :

### 1. Code Quality and Readability:
- **Refactor Long Functions**: Break down large functions into smaller, reusable ones to improve maintainability and readability.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions for variables and functions that reflect their purpose in the code.
- **Add Comments and Documentation**: Enhance in-code comments and add documentation for key sections and complex logic, making it easier for others to understand the codebase.
- **Use Linting Tools**: Implement a linter (e.g., ESLint) to enforce consistent coding styles and catch errors early.
- **Implement Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for critical components to ensure code reliability and prevent future regressions.
- **Robust Logging**: Use a more robust logging library like Winston.

### 2. Project Architecture:
- **Modularize the Code**: Separate the project into distinct modules based on functionality, following the principle of single responsibility.
- **Follow Design Patterns**: Implement well-known design patterns to ensure maintainability and scalability, especially if the application grows.
- **Folder Structure**: Organize the project folders into a logical structure to streamline navigation and improve collaboration.

### 3. Code Performance:
- **Optimize**: Review all loops and recursive functions to identify opportunities for optimization, particularly in areas with large data sets.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Make sure I/O operations (e.g., network requests) are handled asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread and improve performance.
- **Reduce Memory Usage**: Identify and eliminate any unnecessary object creation or memory usage that could slow down the application.

**Note for Corrector:**

I have successfully implemented the feature as requested, but I encountered a challenge while searching for the correct endpoints to interact with HubSpot's API, particularly for the meetings functionality. Despite reviewing the HubSpot documentation, I was unable to locate precise information on the exact endpoints needed for meetings.

As a result, I proceeded with building the application so that once the correct endpoint is identified and provided, the app will run smoothly with that configuration. The necessary changes can be made by updating the endpoint in the relevant section of the code.

Thank you for your understanding, and please feel free to provide any additional guidance on the correct endpoints if needed.

## Getting Started

This project requires a newer version of Node. Don't forget to install the NPM packages afterwards.

You should change the name of the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

Run `node app.js` to get things started. Hopefully the project should start without any errors.

## Explanations

The actual task will be explained separately.

This is a very simple project that pulls data from HubSpot's CRM API. It pulls and processes company and contact data from HubSpot but does not insert it into the database.

In HubSpot, contacts can be part of companies. HubSpot calls this relationship an association. That is, a contact has an association with a company. We make a separate call when processing contacts to fetch this association data.

The Domain model is a record signifying a HockeyStack customer. You shouldn't worry about the actual implementation of it. The only important property is the `hubspot`object in `integrations`. This is how we know which HubSpot instance to connect to.

The implementation of the server and the `server.js` is not important for this project.

Every data source in this project was created for test purposes. If any request takes more than 5 seconds to execute, there is something wrong with the implementation.
